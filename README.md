   *** Save device as SAME name as before to keep IFTTT and other API hooks<br>
   *** If you change the name of device make sure amd change device names in API's like IFTTT<br>

4) Load your code in [https://build.particle.io](https://build.particle.io) 

5) Select correct Photon here: [https://build.particle.io/build/new#devices](https://build.particle.io/build/new#devices)
